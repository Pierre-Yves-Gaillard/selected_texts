\section{The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory} 

\nn{\footnotesize\textbf{Abstract.} We give a short and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory (FTGT) for finite degree extensions.}\so

\nn We derive the FTGT (for finite degree extensions) from two statements, denoted (a) and (b). These two statements, and the way they are proved here, go back at least to Emil Artin (precise references are given below).

The argument is essentially taken from Chapter II of Emil Artin's Notre Dame Lectures [A]. More precisely, statement (a) below is implicitly contained in the proof Theorem 10 page 31 of [A], in which the uniqueness up to isomorphism of the splitting field of a polynomial is verified. Artin's proof shows in fact that, when the roots of the polynomial are distinct, the number of automorphisms of the splitting extension coincides with the degree of the extension. Statement (b) below is proved as Theorem 14 page 42 of [A]. The proof given here (using Artin's argument) was written with Keith Conrad's help.\so

\centerline{\textbf{Theorem}} 

\nn Let $E/F$ be an extension of fields, let $a_1,\dots,a_n$ be distinct generators of $E/F$ such that $p:=(X-a_1)\cdots(X-a_n)$ is in $F[X]$. Then

$\bullet$ the group $G$ of automorphisms of $E/F$ is finite,

$\bullet$ there is a bijective correspondence between the sub-extensions $S/F$ of $E/F$ and the subgroups $H$ of $G$, and we have
$$
S\leftrightarrow H\iff H=\text{Aut}(E/S)\iff S=E^H\implies[E:S]=|H|,
$$
where $E^H$ is the fixed subfield of $H$, where $[E:S]$ is the degree (that is the dimension) of $E$ over $S$, and where $|H|$ is the order of $H$.\so

\centerline{\textbf{Proof}} 

\nn We claim:  

(a) If $S/F$ is a sub-extension of $E/F$, then $[E:S]=|\text{Aut}(E/S)|$.  

(b) If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $|H|=[E:E^H]$.  

\nn\textbf{Proof that (a) and (b) imply the theorem.} Let $S/F$ be a sub-extension of $E/F$ and put $H:=\text{Aut}(E/S)$. Then we have trivially $S\subset E^H$, and (a) and (b) imply 
$$
[E:S]=[E:E^H].
$$
Conversely let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and set $\overline H:=\text{Aut}(E/E^H)$. Then we have trivially $H\subset\overline H$, and (a) and (b) imply $|H|=|\overline H|$.

\nn\textbf{Proof of (a).} Let $1\le i\le n$. Put $K:=S[a_1,\dots,a_{i-1}]$ and $d:=[K[a_i]:K]$. It suffices to check that any $F$-embedding $\phi$ of $K$ in $E$ has exactly $d$ extensions to an $F$-embedding $\Phi$ of $K[a_i]$ in $E$. Let $q\in K[X]$ be the minimal polynomial of $a_i$ over $K$. It is enough to verify that $\phi(q)$ (the image under $\phi$ of $q$) has $d$ distinct roots in $E$. But this is clear since $q$ divides $p$, and thus $\phi(q)$ divides $\phi(p)=p$.

\nn\textbf{Proof of (b).} In view of (a) it is enough to check $|H|\ge[E:E^H]$. Let $k$ be an integer larger than $|H|$, and pick a 
$$
b=(b_1,\dots,b_k)\in E^k.
$$
We must show that the $b_i$ are linearly dependent over $E^H$, or equivalently that $b^\perp\cap(E^H)^k$ is nonzero, where $\bullet^\perp$ denotes the vectors orthogonal to $\bullet$ in $E^k$ with respect to the dot product on $E^k$. Any element of $b^\perp\cap (E^H)^k$ is necessarily orthogonal to $hb$ for any $h\in H$, so 
$$
b^\perp\cap(E^H)^k=(Hb)^\perp\cap(E^H)^k,
$$ 
where $Hb$ is the $H$-orbit of $b$. We will show that $(Hb)^\perp\cap(E^H)^k$ is nonzero. Since the span of $Hb$ in $E^k$ has $E$-dimension at most $|H|<k$, $(Hb)^\perp$ is nonzero. Choose a nonzero vector $x$ in $(Hb)^\perp$ such that $x_i=0$ for the largest number of $i$ as possible among all nonzero vectors in $(Hb)^\perp$. Some coordinate $x_j$ is nonzero in $E$, so by scaling we can assume $x_j=1$ for some $j$. Since the subspace $(Hb)^\perp$ in $E^k$ is stable under the action of $H$, for any $h$ in $H$ we have $hx \in(Hb)^\perp$, so $hx-x\in(Hb)^\perp$. Since $x_j=1$, the $j$-th coordinate of $hx-x$ is $0$, so $hx-x=0$ by the choice of $x$. Since this holds for all $h$ in $H$, $x$ is in $(E^H)^k$.\so

\section{Function of a Matrix} 

\nn{\footnotesize\textbf{Abstract.} Let $a$ be a square matrix with complex entries and $f$ a function holomorphic on an open subset $U$ of the complex plane. It is well known that $f$ can be evaluated on $a$ if the spectrum of $a$ is contained in $U$. We show that, for a fixed $f$, the resulting matrix depends holomorphically on $a$.}

The following was explained to me by Jean-Pierre Ferrier, and Ahmed Jeddi made useful comments.

For any matrix $a$ in $A:=M_n(\C)$, write $\Lambda(a)$ for the set of eigenvalues of $a$. For each $\lambda$ in $\Lambda(a)$, write $1_\lambda\in\C[a]$ for the projector onto the $\lambda$-generalized eigenspace parallel to the other generalized eigenspaces, and put $a_\lambda:=a1_\lambda$, and $z_\lambda:=z1_\lambda$ for $z$ in $\C$. 

Let $U$ be an open subset of $\C$, let $U'$ be the subset of $A$, which is open by Rouch\'e's Theorem, defined by the condition $\Lambda(a)\subset U$, let $a$ be in $U'$, let $X$ be an indeterminate, let $\mathcal O(U)$ be the $\C$-algebra of holomorphic functions on $U$, and equip $\mathcal O(U)$ and $\C[a]$ with the $\C[X]$-algebra structures associated respectively with the element $z\mapsto z$ of $\mathcal O(U)$ and the element $a$ of $\C[a]$. 

\nn\textbf{Theorem 1.} (i) \emph{There is a unique $\C[X]$-algebra morphism from $\mathcal O(U)$ to $\C[a]$. We denote this morphism by $f\mapsto f(a)$.}

\nn(ii) \emph{The map $U'\ni a\mapsto f(a)\in A$ is holomorphic.}

\nn(iii) \emph{For any $a$ in $U'$ we have} 
$$
f(a)=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda(a),0\le k<n}\frac{f^{(k)}(\lambda)_\lambda}{k!}\ (a-\lambda)^k.
$$

\nn\emph{Proof of} (i) and (iii). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $\C[a]$ is isomorphic to the product of $\C[X]$-algebras of the form $\C[X]/(X-\lambda)^m$, with $\lambda\in\C$. So we can assume that $\C[a]$ is of this form, and the lemma follows from the fact that, for any $f$ in $\mathcal O(U)$, there is unique $g$ in $\mathcal O(U)$ such that 
$$
f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\ \frac{f^{(k)}(\lambda)}{k!}\ (z-\lambda)^k+(z-\lambda)^mg(z)
$$ 
for all $z$ in $U$. q.e.d.
 
Say that a \emph{cycle} is a formal finite sum of smooth closed curves. Let $\gamma$ be a cycle in $U\setminus\Lambda(a)$ such that $I(\gamma,\lambda)=1$ for all $\lambda\in\Lambda(a)$ (where $I(\gamma,\lambda)$ is the winding number of $\gamma$ around $\lambda$), and let $N$ be the set of those $b$ in $A$ such that $\Lambda(b)\subset U$, and that $\gamma$ is a cycle in $U\setminus\Lambda(b)$ satisfying $I(\gamma,\lambda)=1$ for all $\lambda\in\Lambda(b)$. As already observed, Rouch\'e's Theorem implies that $N$ is an open neighborhood of $a$ in $A$. Theorem~2 below will imply Part~(ii) of Theorem~1.

\nn\textbf{Theorem 2.} \emph{We have  
$$
f(b)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\ \frac{f(z)}{z-b}\ dz
$$
for all $f$ in $\mathcal O(U)$ and all $b$ in $N$. In particular the map $b\mapsto f(b)$ from $U'$ to $A$ is holomorphic.}

\nn\emph{Proof}. We have 
$$
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\ \frac{f(z)}{z-b}\ dz
$$
$$
=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\ \frac{f(z)}{z-b}\ \sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda(b)}1_\lambda\ dz
$$
$$
=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda(b)}\frac{1_\lambda}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\ \frac{f(z)}{z-b}\ dz
$$
$$
=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda(b)}\frac{1_\lambda}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\ \frac{f(z)\ dz}{(z-\lambda)-(b-\lambda)}
$$
$$
=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda(b)}\frac{1_\lambda}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\ f(z)\ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\ 
\frac{(b-\lambda)^k}{(z-\lambda)^{k+1}}\ dz
$$
$$
=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda(b),0\le k<n}\frac{1_\lambda}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\ \frac{f(z)\ dz}{(z-\lambda)^{k+1}}\ (b-\lambda)^k
$$
$$
\overset{(*)}{=}\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda(b),0\le k<n}I(\gamma,\lambda)\ \frac{f^{(k)}(\lambda)_\lambda}{k!}\ (b-\lambda)^k
$$
$$
=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda(b),0\le k<n}\frac{f^{(k)}(\lambda)_\lambda}{k!}\ (b-\lambda)^k
$$
$$
\overset{(**)}{=}f(b),
$$
where Equality~$(*)$ follows from the Residue Theorem, and Equality~$(**)$ from Part~(iii) of Theorem~1. q.e.d.

\section{Zorn's Lemma} 

\nn{\footnotesize\textbf{Abstract.} We give a short proof of Zorn's Lemma.}

Let $P$ be a poset. Assume that all well-ordered subsets of $P$ have an upper bound, and that $P$ has no maximal element. We'll get a contradiction. 

For any pair $I\subset S$ of subsets of $P$, say that $I$ is an \textbf{initial segment} of $S$ if $S\ni s<i\in I$ implies $s\in I$. For any well-ordered subset $W$ of $P$ choose an element $p(W)$ in $P_{>W}$, \emph{i.e.} $p(W)\in P$ and $p(W)>w$ for all $w$ in $W$. Let $\mathcal W$ be the set of those well-ordered subsets $W$ of $P$ such that $p(W_{<w})=w$ [self-explanatory notation] for all $w$ in $W$, and let $U\subset P$ be the union of $\mathcal W$. 

We claim that $U$ is in $\mathcal W$. This will give the contradiction $U\cup\{p(U)\}\in\mathcal W$. 

We have: 

(a) if $W,X$ are in $\mathcal W$, then $W$ is an initial segment of $X$, or $X$ is an initial segment of $W$; in particular $U$ is totally ordered;

(b) any $W\in\mathcal W$ is an initial segment of $U$; 

(c) $U$ is in $\mathcal W$.

To prove (a) let $I$ be the set of those $p$ in $P$ which belong to some initial segment common to $W$ and $X$. Then $I$ is the largest such initial segment. Moreover $I$ is equal to $W$ or to $X$ because otherwise $I\cup\{p(I)\}$ would contradict the maximality of $I$, for, $W$ and $X$ being well-ordered, we would have $W_{<w}=I=X_{<x}$ for some $w$ in $W$ and some $x$ in $X$, yielding $w=p(I)=x$. 

Now (b) follows from (a). 

We prove (c). To check that $U$ is well-ordered, let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $U$, choose a $W$ in $\mathcal W$ which meets $A$, let $m$ be the minimum of $W\cap A$, and let $a$ be in $A$. We must show $m\le a$. If such was not the case, (a) would imply $a<m$, in contradiction with (b). It remains to prove $p(U_{<u})=u$ for $u$ in $U$, that is, $U_{<u}\subset W$ for $u\in W\in\mathcal W$. This follows from (b).
